# SQL Index and Data Source Cache

SQL Index and Data Source Cache is an optimized plug-in package designed to accelerate Spark SQL\* performance by using index and cache technology at the Spark* SQL data source layer. Indexing can improve Spark interactive query performance by as much as an order of magnitude, and caching delivers additional Spark* SQL query performance benefits. We support both DRAM and Intel® Optane™ Persistent Memory as cache media.
